# Practice with basic HTTP Session-Based authentication system
========================

This quick sprint assignment to build basic authentication (Digest Auth & session-based authentication) in Rails App (with only User Model and user basic data seeded). There is no no styling or anything complicated as the main focus is auth.

## Getting Started

To get the app started locally you'll need to:

1. Clone the repo with `git clone REPO_URL`
2. `cd` into the project
3. Run
  - `$ bundle install`
  - `$ bundle exec rake db:migrate`
  - `$ bundle exec rake db:seed`
(# take a look around the schema file to see how models were created)

4. Start up the server with `rails s` command and fire http://localhost:3000. You can set up and account and login back.
